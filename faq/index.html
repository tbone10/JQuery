               First we will talk about your goals and then we will find several solutions to consider.  A simple approach can often be completed in 1-2 weeks and a totally custom project can take several more weeks.  The production quantity and amount of handwork often play a role.  An initial rollout with simple materials and techniques can entice the market and then be followed by a more sophisticated approach tailored to feedback and response.  We will find a way to get your product to the marketplace right away and keep the pipeline full!
